## Notes

08/08

Initially I had some issues with TypeScript and VSCode - I spent roughly 45 minutes trying to fix linting errors when the solution was to restart VSCode. In all honesty I'd never come across this issue and feel a bit silly taking so long to find the solution.

I struggled with TypeScript a fair bit actually - specifically as I've not used the class syntax with Vue before and I still wasn't able to get things right. It would have probably been wise for me to stick to what I'm use to working with. I had initially installed a few packages that were meant to simplify development but ultimately just made it hard for me to read / understand as I usually would.
